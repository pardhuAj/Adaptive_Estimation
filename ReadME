# RL Estimation Code Repo

### Feb 1, 2025
Notes:
Python code for RL is added.
The code needs debuggin in general.
The learning loop needs to be changed. Q,R cannot be introuduced as actions at every timestep. This will result in the process being non-stationary. The essential work around is to initialize an entire stream of measurements during the reset and use those measurements in the RL loop. Onces the Q,R settle to a value, it can be used in the actual filtering loop.
